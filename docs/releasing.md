# Releases

This document describes how the release flow looks like and how to create an `helm-broker` release.

## Release process

Every change in the master branch which passes all checks creates the `latest` tag and triggers the release.

Every tag pushed to the repository triggers a new release.

### Create a release from the master branch

Follow these steps to create a new `helm-broker` release `v0.6.0`:

1. Checkout on master and pull the latest changes:

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```
2. Prepare the release:

    ```
    make VERSION=v0.6.0 cut-release
    ```
Above command do the following things:
  - changes the images tag in the `charts/helm-broker/values.yaml` to `v0.6.0`
  - creates a commit with the changes
  - creates a `v0.6.0` tag

3. Push the release:

    ```
    git push {remote} v0.6.0
    ```

It triggers the Prow CI release job for Helm Broker.

    >**NOTE:** If you want to push the tag to the upstream, run the following command:
    >```
    >git push upstream v0.6.0
    >```

4. After Prow CI job finish, go to the **releases** tab where the new release appears. The new branch is available in the **branches** tab.


### Create a release from the release branch

Follow these steps to create a new `helm-broker` release 0.6.1:

1. Checkout the release branch with the latest changes. For example:

    ```
    git fetch {remote}
    git checkout release-0.6
    git pull
    ```

2. Commit your changes to the release branch `release-0.6`.
>**NOTE:** In order to have a complete changelog, create a Pull Requests to the release branch

3. Prepare the release:

    ```
    make VERSION=v0.6.1 cut-release
    ```
    Above command do the following things:
      - changes the images tag in the `charts/helm-broker/values.yaml` to `v0.6.1`
      - creates a commit with the changes
      - creates a `v0.6.1` tag 

4. Push your changes with the tag:

    ```
    git push {remote} v0.6.1
    ```

5. After Prow CI job finish, go to the **releases** tab where the new `v0.6.1` release appears.


## Changelog functionality

Every time you create a new release, the changelog file is generated and it's placed in the release body.

Every changelog file contains a list of pull requests and issues from the period between the releases. It's generated by [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator).
You can configure the changelog generator in the `.github_changelog_generator` file according to the [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#params-file) documentation.
