# Releases

This document describes how the release flow looks like and how to create an `helm-broker` release.

## Release process

Every change in the master branch which passes all checks creates the `latest` tag and triggers the release.

Every tag pushed to the repository triggers a new release. If the tag name matches the `x.y.0` version pattern, in which `0` is a revision, Prow CI build creates a release tag named `release-x.y`.

### Create a release from the master branch

Follow these steps to create a new `helm-broker` release 0.6.0:

1. Checkout the master branch with the latest changes:

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```

2. Create a tag with the proper release version:

    ```
    git tag 0.6.0
    ```   

3. Push the tag:

    ```
    git push {remote} 0.6.0
    ```

    >**NOTE:** If you want to push the tag to the upstream, run the following command:
    >```
    >git push upstream 0.6.0
    >```


4. After Prow CI job finish, go to the **releases** tab where the new release appears. The new branch is available in the **branches** tab.


### Create a release from the release branch

Follow these steps to create a new addon release 0.6.1:

1. Checkout the release branch with the latest changes. For example:

    ```
    git fetch {remote}
    git checkout release-0.6
    git pull
    ```

2. Create a tag with the proper release version. For example:

    ```
    git tag 0.6.1
    ```   

3. Push the tag:

    ```
    git push {remote} 0.6.1
    ```

4. After Prow CI job finish, go to the **releases** tab where the new `0.6.1` release appears.


## Changelog functionality

Every time you create a new release, two changelog files are generated. One refers to a specific release and the other one to the whole `helm-broker` repository.

Every changelog file contains a list of pull requests and issues from the period between the releases. It's generated by [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator).
You can configure the generator in the `.github_changelog_generator` file according to the [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#params-file) documentation.
