# Pkg directory

Library code to use by external applications. Other projects will import these libraries expecting them to work.

## Purpose

The `/pkg` directory is a good way to explicitly communicate that the code in that directory is safe for use by others.
Note that the `/internal` directory is a better way to ensure your private packages.
